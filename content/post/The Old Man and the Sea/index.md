The Old Man and the Sea
Ernest Hemingway
Short Story
The Old Man and the Sea" is a novella by Ernest Hemingway that tells the story of Santiago, an aging Cuban fisherman, and his epic struggle with a giant marlin in the Gulf Stream. Despite his skill and determination, Santiago is tested by the relentless fish, resulting in a three-day battle of endurance. Hemingway conveys themes of resilience, and the relationship between man and nature. The Old Man and the Sea is a symbolic tale that reflects on man's ability to endure and find meaning in the face of impossible challenges.
This story was moving in that it was very symbolic, yet simple. The short and sweet story effectively enhanced my understanding of human endurance in the face of adversity and struggle. The large marlin representing struggle and Santaigoâ€™s endurance was noteworthy to me, as it was a persuasive and entertaining way to convey the theme.
Ernest Hemingway was an American novelist and short story writer. The Old Man and the Sea was a key novella in his works, winning the 1953 Pulitzer Prize.
