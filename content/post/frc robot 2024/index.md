2024 FRC Robot CAD

To practice using onshape, I CADed the basic structure of a 2024 FRC robot, and used mates to define its range of motion. The Robot is capable of scoring in the speaker and amp, and climbing. I started outlining the motor placement, and started designing gear boxes, but I have not added them to the assembly.
